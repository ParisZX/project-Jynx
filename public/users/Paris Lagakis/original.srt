00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:04,632
This alliance
that you've created

3
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:06,834
with this new set of aliens --
is a load of crap.

4
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:08,859
They have given us no cause
to doubt their loyalty.

5
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,365
What is
going on with you?!

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,623
I've been
going to see Karen.

7
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:13,207
She implanted something
in me.

8
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,083
I don't think
she's human.

9
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:17,073
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:18,575
I work for the real President,

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,791
Benjamin Hathaway.

12
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,293
If Benjamin Hathaway
is alive,

13
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:22,789
we don't know
where he is.

14
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,814
The Espheni are coming.
We're all gonna die.

15
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,256
Hey, let me fight!

18
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:15,029
What's going on?

19
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:16,864
I don't know.

20
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:20,127
What's up?

21
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,461
- It's Anne and Alexis.
- What about them?

22
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:23,498
They're missing.

23
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,611
Dr. Glass asked me

24
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,681
to analyze the DNA
of 12 de-harnessed children.

25
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,185
11 presented with no
abnormalities whatsoever.

26
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,790
But one showed signs
of alien DNA,

27
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:46,259
the strands intertwining
with human DNA

28
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:48,996
like kudzu in
a Northwestern rainforest.

29
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,532
It's a vine-like plant
in the genus pueraria --

30
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,001
Doctor, please.
The point.

31
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:58,973
The baby...Is not human.

32
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,581
So...she's an alien?

33
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:10,719
No, she's a hybrid,
a-an entirely new species.

34
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:13,756
At least, that's
my preliminary analysis.

35
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,091
After Dr. Glass
left Dr. Kadar,

36
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,661
she went back to her room,
drugged Lourdes,

37
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:19,596
and, as far as we can tell,
she took Alexis,

38
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:20,764
but we don't know where.

39
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,966
We were having
a glass of wine,

40
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:26,003
and...the --
the next thing I knew,

41
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,673
C-Colonel Weaver
was shaking me awake.

42
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,910
So...
she just disappeared?

43
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:33,778
Seems that way.

44
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,747
And they're not
in Charleston anywhere?

45
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,782
We've searched everywhere.

46
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,019
Dr. Glass wouldn't just
run away. That's not like her.

47
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,088
It's possible
she was afraid

48
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,756
what would happen if people
found out about the baby.

49
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,127
I think she just did
what any mother would do.

50
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,996
I agree -- Anne is not
the type of person

51
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,999
who goes around knocking people
out or -- or drugging them.

52
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,168
Colonel,
if she's in the badlands --

53
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:55,882
we're gonna need a search party.

54
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,584
Won't need more than 50,
maybe 100 volunteers.

55
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,161
Colonel.

56
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,673
Travel by horseback --
cover more ground that way.

57
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:00,874
Colonel Weaver!

58
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,810
Ms. Peralta.

59
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,845
A moment, please.

60
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:13,622
I need you to get
some perspective here.

61
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,091
On what, Ms. Peralta?

62
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,160
You know we can't afford
100 people for a search party.

63
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:19,662
We can't afford 50 people
or 20 people.

64
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,263
We can't afford anyone.

65
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,798
We're talking about Anne Glass
and her newborn daughter,

66
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,026
Tom Mason's newborn daughter.

67
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,301
I understand that.

68
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,870
I'm not sure you do.

69
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:29,338
I most certainly do,

70
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:32,175
but there are 5,000 other lives
that I have to consider.

71
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,277
Now, if you want to go
look for her,

72
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:38,147
and I assume you do,
you have my blessing.

73
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,683
I can't conduct an effective
search by myself.

74
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,418
- You know that.
- I'm sorry.

75
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:43,953
It's my final decision.

76
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,421
Ms. Peralta,
when Tom left you in charge,

77
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,123
I don't think
that he counted on --

78
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,292
Counted on what,
Colonel?

79
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:51,026
Looking out for the best
interest of Charleston?

80
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,728
Because I believe
that's exactly

81
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,398
what he was counting on from me,
and from you, as well.

82
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:57,667
Ms. Peralta.

83
00:04:57,702 --> 00:05:03,173
I can't expect you
to understand

84
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,875
what we in the 2nd Mass
went through,

85
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:08,043
but we came out
of it a family,

86
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,313
a family dedicated
to each other, come what may.

87
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:14,149
And that's what the 2nd Mass
has come to stand for.

88
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:16,851
That's what we've been
fighting for.

89
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,719
And if one of us is lost,
we find them,

90
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:22,253
and if one of us
is in trouble, we help them.

91
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,946
Fine. 24 hours.

92
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,379
All right, then.
And if you do find them,

93
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,479
we'll need to figure out a way
how to handle the baby.

94
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,393
What do you mean, "handle"?
Dr. Glass was right.

95
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:36,180
God knows how people will react
to a hybrid child.

96
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:39,414
First things first.

97
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,280
Yes, first things first.

98
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:43,180
And by the way...

99
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:45,347
I had a family, too...

100
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:47,014
Once.

101
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:50,381
I completely understand
what we're fighting for --

102
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,115
completely.

103
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,085
What happened?

104
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,718
We crashed.

105
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,120
Bressler?

106
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:16,820
Dead.

107
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,987
You pulled me
out of that thing?

108
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,688
Didn't take them long
to find us.

109
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,622
Or Keystone
for that matter.

110
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,222
Yeah, well, considering the fact
that you led them

111
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,989
right to it, I'm surprised it
took them as long as it did.

112
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:35,857
Could have let you burn
on that plane.

113
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:39,690
Charleston has a mole.
Everybody knows it.

114
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,991
Only instead of delaying
your trip to Keystone

115
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:43,858
to find out
who the damn spy was,

116
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,158
you -- you wanted to
go and play

117
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,825
with the big boys,
didn't you?

118
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:50,026
Parley with the President
of the United States.

119
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,060
Well, I hope
it was worth it, huh?

120
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,728
You get the President killed,
Bressler's dead.

121
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:58,596
And I'm out
a damn fine airplane. Geez.

122
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,599
It looks like they're leaving.
We got to move.

123
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:03,933
No, stay here for a while, all
right? Wait until they leave.

124
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,633
- Suit yourself.
- No! Down!

125
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:10,301
Stay down!

126
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:34,809
Listen, if there's
one thing I know,

127
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:37,677
it's how to hide from
the authorities, all right?

128
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:40,645
Let's just stay here.
We wait it out until they pass.

129
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,100
You're not
leaving me behind.

130
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,902
Come on, buddy.
It's not safe out there.

131
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:57,737
I don't care.

132
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,739
Anne and Alexis are just as
important to me as anyone else.

133
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:02,242
Well, you're not going.
And that's that.

134
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:03,509
Damn it!

135
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,811
Hey!
Watch your language, son.

136
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:07,179
Now,
what's going on here?

137
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:08,681
Hal said that I couldn't go,
but I said --

138
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,182
Of course
you're coming with.

139
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:11,951
- Sir --
- No buts about it, Hal.

140
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,819
Matt's coming.
That's an order.

141
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:15,287
He can ride with me.

142
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,688
- I'll make sure nothing happens to him.
- Right.

143
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,957
Let's go.

144
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,592
- Colonel.
- Ms. Peralta.

145
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,094
Listen, I didn't mean
to come across as -- as un--

146
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,196
I got what you were saying,
Ms. Peralta.

147
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,633
What I wanted to say --
I-I wa--

148
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:32,103
just get yourself back to
Charleston safely, Colonel.

149
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,672
We can't do without you.

150
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,881
She likes you, dad.

151
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:46,183
Who? Ms. Peralta?
That woman hates me.

152
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,185
- Dad.
- What?

153
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:51,154
Let's head out!

154
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:11,908
Let's go.

155
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:14,644
Which way?

156
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,212
South,
back to Charleston.

157
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:19,248
How the hell do you know
that south ain't that way?

158
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:20,683
Moss.

159
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,985
Grows on the north --
less sun.

160
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,720
South.

161
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,188
Very good.

162
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,357
But you also know that
Charleston has got to be, what,

163
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,859
400 miles
as the crow flies?

164
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,560
So, even if we're covering
three miles an hour,

165
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,162
times 10 hours a day,
if we find a road --

166
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,999
actually, they'll be looking for
the road, so we can't even --

167
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,625
Lieutenant Fisher didn't give us
the coordinates till we were airborne.

168
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:40,530
What?

169
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,275
Spy couldn't have known
where we were going.

170
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,008
He didn't have the coordinates.
We didn't have the coordinates.

171
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,244
He knew we were going.
He didn't need to know where.

172
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:48,912
Look, Professor, you know
as well as I do, they got --

173
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,714
they got eyes
in the sky, right?

174
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,216
Then why did it take them
so long to get to Keystone?

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,655
You are the <i>King</i> of chaos,
Mason.

176
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,925
Do you know that?
It follows you.

177
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,260
Don't try to explain it.
Just own it.

178
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,262
You still owe me
an airplane.

179
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,219
What you got, son?

180
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,954
Blood.

181
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:34,924
Dismount.

182
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,129
Jeanne, Maggie, Hal,
spread out.

183
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:51,840
It's still fresh.

184
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:12,962
Up here!

185
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:15,464
No!

186
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:17,466
Matt, stay!

187
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,701
It's not Anne.

188
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,741
Skitters?

189
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:02,443
Could be.
I'm not sure.

190
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:04,879
We need to bury her.

191
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:06,381
We don't even know her.

192
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:09,050
It doesn't matter.

193
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:14,155
No, Matt's right.
We can't just leave her here.

194
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,527
Come on, Hal.
Come give us a hand.

195
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:28,436
Ohh, God.

196
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:31,338
We should put up here
for the night.

197
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,908
No,
we should keep moving.

198
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:35,376
Still got a couple hours
of light left. Let's go.

199
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,912
No, we should make a fire.
We need to eat something.

200
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:40,148
Look, in case
you missed the memo,

201
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:43,185
fire...Is what
attracts them, see?

202
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,854
We could die of exposure,
starvation,

203
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,856
and then
it wouldn't matter.

204
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,392
Are you going soft, Mason?
It's not that cold.

205
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,928
It will be
when the sun goes down.

206
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:55,064
Make a fire.

207
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:57,199
Yeah,
while you do what?

208
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:00,068
What's the matter, Pope?
You don't know how?

209
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:01,336
Hey, you know what?

210
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,538
You want your fire
bad enough there,

211
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,907
Mr. Boy Scout,
you make it yourself.

212
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:07,342
You <i>don't</i> know how,
do you?

213
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:08,810
How could you
survive this long

214
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,205
without knowing
how to make a fire?

215
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:23,456
I just got this image
of young Tommy Mason

216
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:25,992
out there in the wilderness
with his old man.

217
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,260
Huh?

218
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,329
"Behold, my son,
the miracle of fire."

219
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,531
I just got an image...

220
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:34,066
Of a young Johnny Pope
sitting on his ass

221
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,969
making wisecracks
while the other kids played.

222
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:44,242
My father wasn't really
the outdoorsman type.

223
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:47,078
Too busy managing
his stock portfolio, huh?

224
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:49,080
Owned a hardware store.

225
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:51,984
Never made it past
the 7th grade.

226
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,985
But he knew his tools.

227
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,622
Well, sounds like my
Norman Rockwell upbringing.

228
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:59,425
My father was a drunk.

229
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,363
Angry, mean drunk.

230
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,466
There was nothing idyllic
about my childhood.

231
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:13,338
Except that
maybe I survived it.

232
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,523
It's for the tree.

233
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:35,394
Think we should
say...something?

234
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:39,866
All right.

235
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,205
I don't know
who this woman was.

236
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,941
She didn't deserve
to die this way.

237
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:52,278
And she's in a better place.
Amen.

238
00:14:58,153 --> 00:14:59,486
I'm glad we found her.

239
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,956
Do you think
she had a family?

240
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:07,427
Yeah. Probably.

241
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,331
Bet she was
a good mother.

242
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:14,534
Yeah, I'm guessing so.

243
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,638
Probably just...
looking for food for her kids.

244
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:21,675
Like a good mother
would.

245
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,946
Before all this,
probably would have...

246
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,983
taken her daughter for ice cream
after a volleyball game,

247
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,651
even if
she  lost.

248
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,187
She waited up for her daughter
to come home

249
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,189
from her first date.

250
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:37,491
Not 'cause she was worried
about her,

251
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:41,261
but...because
she wanted to hear all about it.

252
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:42,562
She'll be missed.

253
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:46,600
But she'll always
be loved.

254
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,276
Right.
Let's get her covered up.

255
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,750
Dr. Kadar?

256
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:13,155
Roger?

257
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,491
Marina!
I know why you're here.

258
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,326
You do?

259
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:20,530
And I think I have everything
almost ready.

260
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,699
Wh-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

261
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,434
Uh, testing.

262
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:25,735
What testing?

263
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,771
Lourdes -- uh,
that is to say, Dr. Delgado,

264
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,640
gave me a list
of all the children

265
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,775
born in the last six months
here in Charleston --

266
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,210
eight to be exact --

267
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,878
including, of course,
Dr. Glass' child.

268
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:38,280
And then it was just a matter
of comparing the DNA samples.

269
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,782
Doctor, that's
a very important project,

270
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,284
and I'd like
to discuss it further,

271
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:42,518
but that's not why
I'm here.

272
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,819
All right.

273
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:47,690
I'm, uh...I'm sorry.
What is it?

274
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:52,595
This is what the Volm
are building.

275
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:55,765
Yes.
How did you know?

276
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:58,801
It's not hard
to figure out.

277
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:01,237
Where did you
get these photos?

278
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:02,772
That's not important.

279
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,374
What is important
and what I hope you can tell me

280
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:06,410
is what this thing
does exactly.

281
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:07,911
"Exactly"?
From these photos?

282
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,947
Well, you're the only one
I could think of

283
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:11,649
who could possibly
figure it out.

284
00:17:11,716 --> 00:17:13,418
All right. I'll try.

285
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:15,453
That's all I can ask.

286
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:16,888
Marina...

287
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:18,890
Yes.

288
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,258
...does Tom Mason
know about this?

289
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,526
Yes.

290
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,461
He's the one who asked me
to come here.

291
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,102
Matt.

292
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,279
Not hungry.

293
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,481
You should eat anyway.

294
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,488
Do you think
mom died alone?

295
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:56,992
Like...that woman?

296
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,361
Um...

297
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:02,798
I don't know.
I don't know.

298
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:08,036
I hope not.

299
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,474
You remember the last time
you saw mom?

300
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,777
Yeah.

301
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,314
I...saw her leaving
that morning just...

302
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,015
through the window.

303
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,851
All I could see was the bottom
of her legs

304
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,352
from where I was sitting,

305
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:27,923
her jeans, pink Nikes
dad got her for that cancer run.

306
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:31,126
Yeah, I...I remember.

307
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:32,828
The next time I saw her,

308
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,997
she was lying on the picnic
table in the backyard

309
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,001
after dad had gone
and found her.

310
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,869
One of her shoes
was missing.

311
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:43,306
I should have gone to look
for that shoe.

312
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,312
We're gonna find her,
right?

313
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,280
Anne, I mean.

314
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:54,417
We're gonna try.

315
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:02,959
Hey. Eat.

316
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,767
Thanks.

317
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,436
For what?

318
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,338
For not lying.

319
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:24,147
Huh? I'll tell you,
a little white wine,

320
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:25,448
lemon and garlic,

321
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,117
cayenne pepper,
it'd be almost edible.

322
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:31,155
You much of a cook,
Mason?

323
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:34,558
No. Rebecca did
most of the cooking.

324
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:39,898
I used to make breakfast
for the boys...

325
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,301
On Saturdays sometimes.

326
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:48,173
I liked the smell of bacon
and hash browns in the house.

327
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,610
Hmm. I wasn't much of a cook
when my kids were around.

328
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:54,947
That's right.
You've got two, right?

329
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:58,017
A boy and a girl.
Brandon and Tanya.

330
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,185
When was the last time
you saw them?

331
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,058
Oh, right.

332
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,094
It was five years
before the invasion.

333
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:13,065
Me and, uh -- me and my boy
were working on his minibike.

334
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,401
Had this sweet, little,
old-school Honda

335
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:19,038
that his uncle gave him.

336
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,974
And, uh, swapping out
the rear sprocket...

337
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,843
Give the kid a little extra
torque, you know?

338
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:27,380
He's riding down the driveway,
and this jackass...

339
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:30,917
In a Cadillac --
by <i>that</i> much, man.

340
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:33,587
Almost just run him
right down, right?

341
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,222
I told this guy before.

342
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:36,990
So, I throw Brandon
into the truck.

343
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,326
We follow this son of a bitch,
get out to his house.

344
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,994
He gets out of his car.

345
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,129
I tell him, "hey, man, we got
kids playing in the street."

346
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,031
He tells me,
"yeah, well, get a haircut.

347
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:48,068
Shut your pie hole."

348
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:50,137
And I popped him.

349
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:53,340
So he goes down.

350
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:56,310
And, uh...

351
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,480
I actually --
I started laughing 'cause his --

352
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:02,516
his, uh -- his head
sounded like a melon...

353
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:04,418
when it hit the asphalt.

354
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:10,557
I'll never forget the look
on Brandon's face, though, boy.

355
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:14,428
Just -- I was just
trying to teach him

356
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:19,166
how to stand up for yourself,
you know?

357
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,504
That's --
that's all I was doing.

358
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:26,440
What happened to the guy?
He sue you?

359
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:29,543
No, he bled out
on the driveway.

360
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,216
He ended up dead.

361
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,550
You know what, Mason?

362
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:41,255
I was never cut out
for the...the homelife...

363
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,923
homeowner crap.

364
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,925
Just never my thing,
you know?

365
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,693
And prison --

366
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:49,029
prison was easy.

367
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:51,031
Prison, I-I understood.

368
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:54,034
You know,
that other stuff...

369
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:11,183
I was just gonna take
the first watch.

370
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:34,307
Whoo-hoo!

371
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,609
I don't know about you,

372
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:37,110
but I'm getting a little tired
of frog legs.

373
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:38,344
I thought we'd go epicurean
this morning.

374
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,412
You think that's funny?

375
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:43,583
Ain't nothing funny
about eating snake, man.

376
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:45,251
Asshole.

377
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,286
It's a <i>joke,</i> you puss.

378
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,154
Oh, you think
we're friends now?

379
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:52,558
Share a few campfire stories,
and now we're blood brothers?

380
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:07,095
Move it, Mason!
Move it!

381
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,806
They're flanking us.

382
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:26,579
Whoa, whoa.

383
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,717
It was nice knowing you,
Mason.

384
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:37,857
Get out of the way.

385
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:40,593
No, no, no.
I saw that movie. No way.

386
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:42,262
You got a better idea?
No!

387
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:43,563
No!

388
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:16,245
You want to die?!
Try that again!

389
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,613
Let's finish it.

390
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,117
Let's finish it!

391
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:24,587
It's finished.

392
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:27,156
You win.

393
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,830
Do I want to die?
That's rich.

394
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,033
Mason,
you honestly think...

395
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,002
we're getting out of here
any other way?

396
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,572
Huh?

397
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,844
What?

398
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,345
It's my ankle.

399
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,022
Let's get dry.

400
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,038
How you doing, Jeannie?

401
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,673
I don't know.

402
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,209
What's wrong?

403
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:22,345
Just wondering
if this is how it all ends.

404
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,915
How <i>what</i> ends?

405
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,885
They can't kill us.
They can't dominate us.

406
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,054
So they just turn us
into them?

407
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,957
Create a new species,
half-human, half-alien?

408
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,126
I don't know.

409
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,932
Dad, you have to
promise me something.

410
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,102
You know if I can,
I will.

411
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,637
Don't let them get me,
okay?

412
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,506
What are you
talking about?

413
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,674
You know.

414
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,510
Please.

415
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,047
I don't want them
to use me for --

416
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,583
just promise me,
no matter what, you won't.

417
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,420
Never, ever.

418
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,621
I promise.

419
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,397
Dismount.

420
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:18,600
Let's spread out.
See what we can see.

421
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,540
Hey. You okay?

422
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,542
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

423
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:30,478
You've just been acting weird
this whole time. That's all.

424
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:34,348
Look, it's just this doesn't
make a whole lot of sense.

425
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:37,518
I mean, look. Anne, the baby,
they could be anywhere.

426
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,687
If Anne doesn't
want to be found,

427
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:41,322
she's smart enough
she's not gonna be found.

428
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:43,290
We have to try, right?

429
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,725
I guess so, yeah.

430
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,594
Skitter tracks.

431
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:53,400
Some human prints, too.
Can't tell how many.

432
00:27:57,238 --> 00:27:58,672
They've got her.

433
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,613
We can't be sure, son.

434
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,415
Rebel Skitters, they have spies
in the Espheni system.

435
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:10,251
If anyone can find Anne
and Lexie, it's them.

436
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,089
If they're still alive.

437
00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:20,095
Listen. Anne and your baby
sister are most certainly alive.

438
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,763
All right?

439
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:23,398
How can you be sure?

440
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:25,600
Because if they weren't,
we would have found them.

441
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:28,135
Now, we don't
give up hope ever.

442
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,671
<i>You</i> don't.
And that's an order.

443
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,472
Yes, sir.

444
00:28:37,678 --> 00:28:41,014
When we get back, we'll talk
to your Skitter friends.

445
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:44,350
And we're gonna launch
those rebel spies.

446
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:49,155
Let's mount up
and head home.

447
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:07,673
Give me the belt.

448
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,376
There had to have been a
tracking device on the airplane.

449
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:12,678
That's the only
explanation.

450
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:14,113
What the hell
are you talking about?

451
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,715
That's how they knew
we were at Keystone.

452
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,517
Look, you got to let that go,
Mason.

453
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:20,186
It doesn't matter
anymore.

454
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,189
It's gonna get tight.

455
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:26,058
We got to get moving.

456
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:28,828
Let's go.
Get some weight on it.

457
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:30,563
Come on. Got it?

458
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:36,735
Damn it, Mason.
We don't have a choice.

459
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:42,708
Look, Mason,
we got to go.

460
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:48,746
You hear me?
We're gonna die out here.

461
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,783
We got to go,
and we got to go now.

462
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,485
Go.
No, no. Come on.

463
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,487
I'm not leaving without you.
That's not gonna happen.

464
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:00,757
One more time. Come on.
Let's go. Let's do it.

465
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,526
Just go.
You got what you wanted.

466
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:06,196
You get to walk out
of the woods.

467
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,565
It's not gonna work
that way.

468
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,201
You are gonna
get off your ass,

469
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:13,570
get dressed,
and we are going to move.

470
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:22,378
You owe me an airplane.
That's it.

471
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:24,713
That is the only reason that I
am hauling your ass out of here.

472
00:30:24,748 --> 00:30:26,782
You understand that?
What are you gonna do with an airplane?

473
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,784
You got motorcycles.
You got Humvees.

474
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,753
You can leave Charleston
anytime you want.

475
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,221
Why don't you go?

476
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:33,556
If I did all that,

477
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,257
I think I'd miss out
on all the fun and adventure.

478
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:39,228
Oh, man, it must be nice
to be John Pope,

479
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:41,397
to live life
with no responsibility,

480
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,766
no accountability,
no sense of obligation,

481
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,134
no sense of duty,
no sense of honor,

482
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:47,302
and no sense of remorse!

483
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:48,737
That must be nice!
Shut up.

484
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:53,741
You're a fake!
You're a phony!

485
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:57,245
You are a coward.

486
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,913
I'm gonna die out here.

487
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:00,915
You're gonna die out here
because you don't have the balls

488
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,651
to walk out of here
without me!

489
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,490
I don't like that look.

490
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,560
It doesn't add up.

491
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,495
What doesn't add up?

492
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,727
Let's say
you had a toaster

493
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:17,495
that you wanted me
to power up for you.

494
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,464
Most household appliances use
between 300 and 900 watts.

495
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:23,033
So that's what I'd provide.
That's all I'd provide.

496
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,569
I wouldn't go to the trouble of
creating a system that gives,

497
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:27,938
say, 25,000 watts,

498
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:29,774
which would be enough to run
an electric furnace,

499
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:32,376
because that would be...
overkill.

500
00:32:32,444 --> 00:32:35,446
So, what about this device
is overkill?

501
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:39,951
This <i>thing</i> right here
is connected,

502
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:42,554
like some kind of
massive accumulator.

503
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,789
It's, uh...like
an energy-storage device.

504
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:47,792
And if this weapon uses
plasma armature...

505
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:50,595
and I think it does,
then...

506
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:56,301
It would <i>never</i>
need that much power,

507
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:58,771
not even by a long shot.

508
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:00,105
It would be...

509
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:01,440
It would be overkill.

510
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:04,677
Exactly.

511
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:07,012
So, maybe it's not
what we think it is?

512
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,048
Or what the Volm
are telling us it is.

513
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:10,950
What are the Volm
telling us it is?

514
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:12,351
I don't know.

515
00:33:12,385 --> 00:33:14,353
You don't <i>know?</i>

516
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:17,656
Tom Mason didn't ask you
to look into this, did he?

517
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,658
No, he didn't.

518
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:23,429
And he should have.

519
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:25,097
He should have
told us all.

520
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:30,470
Thank you, Doctor.

521
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:32,972
I assume you won't tell anyone
about this.

522
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:35,675
I think that would be
for the best.

523
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,778
I do have the DNA results back,
by the way,

524
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:40,480
if you're interested.

525
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:42,382
Results?

526
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,817
The DNA results
from the newborns.

527
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:46,486
And?

528
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,354
They're all negative,
except the Glass child.

529
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:49,689
That's good.

530
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,392
Yes.
It is, I think.

531
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:55,529
I think it's <i>very</i> good.

532
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,752
Ahh.

533
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:33,901
Dad. Dad, you got to get up.
How did you find me?

534
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:35,937
They're here. We got to go.
Who's here?

535
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:37,505
We don't have much time.
We have to get up.

536
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,106
Where's Anne?
Where's Lexie?

537
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,621
They need your help. You got to
get up right now! Come on, Dad!

538
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,113
One of you doesn't
go home tonight.

539
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,549
Is it you? Or you?

540
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,800
There's only one thing
on this planet

541
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,069
I can't stand
more than you, Mason.

542
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,606
That's Skitters.

543
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:56,426
Almost there.

544
00:35:58,596 --> 00:36:00,998
It ain't a Harley,
but it'll do.

545
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,434
There's also enough...
gas in this thing.

546
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,537
It should get us
most of the way home.

547
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:12,909
The folks that owned this tub
weren't much on...

548
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:15,445
fine dining...

549
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,449
But, uh...they keep
a good supply of 12 gauge.

550
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:21,985
Oh, here.

551
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,354
The shocks on this buggy
are crap.

552
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:46,675
That's for mom.

553
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:55,983
We never talk
about her anymore.

554
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,450
You notice that?

555
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:58,652
Yeah.

556
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:01,120
How come?

557
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:09,596
I don't know.

558
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:15,936
Hey. What's wrong?

559
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:19,640
I don't want to
be alone, Ben.

560
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,142
Like that lady.

561
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:23,844
I don't want it.

562
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:26,131
I don't want to be --

563
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:28,229
die facedown,
buried by some strangers.

564
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:30,254
Hey. Hey.

565
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:57,111
Hold it!
Stay where you are!

566
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,480
Don't come any further!

567
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:01,448
Don't shoot!

568
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:03,917
It's Tom Mason.

569
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,886
We're coming in.
It's the President.

570
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:10,624
It's President Mason!

571
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:11,958
What happened, sir?

572
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:14,127
We ran out of gas.

573
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:37,752
How long
have I been out?

574
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:39,955
Two days.

575
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,891
How long have you been
sitting in here?

576
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,793
Two days.

577
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:48,162
I lived.

578
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:50,129
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

579
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,022
Yeah, look, I just think we
should get our stories straight.

580
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:54,223
What story would that be?

581
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,125
You saved my ass.
I saved yours.

582
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,262
I'd say
that makes us even.

583
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:05,548
Well, you know what they say
about a tie.

584
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:08,417
It's like
kissing your sister.

585
00:39:10,387 --> 00:39:12,610
Hey.

586
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,612
Now, there's a sight
for sore eyes.

587
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,149
I'm happy to be seen.

588
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:20,318
Pope's filled me in
on what happened.

589
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:21,653
General Bressler --

590
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:24,355
I hear that his flying
saved your lives.

591
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:25,624
It's true.

592
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:28,193
Any word from Cochise
or the President?

593
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:29,761
Radio silence.

594
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:32,030
I assume you've contacted
the Volm.

595
00:39:32,064 --> 00:39:33,598
They're out
looking for him.

596
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,035
Hey. Welcome back.

597
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:38,703
I got
a little headache, Doc.

598
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:40,205
Aside from that,
I feel fine.

599
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,374
If it's all the same
to you, gentlemen,

600
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:43,709
I got a business to run.

601
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,344
Hey, Pope.

602
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,751
Next basket wins.

603
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,181
How are you feeling?

604
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,317
Oh, like I survived
a plane crash.

605
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,166
When can I get
out of here?

606
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:08,035
Um, not for a couple days,
at least.

607
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,872
You were pretty dehydrated,
and it's gonna be a few days

608
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,808
before you can put any weight
on that ankle.

609
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,144
Dad!

610
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,746
Hey.

611
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:21,516
Hey.

612
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,017
Good to see you again,
Dad.

613
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,153
I'm glad you made it.

614
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:29,357
Yeah,
I'm glad I made it, too.

615
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:36,298
Where's Anne?
Where's Alexis?

616
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,692
Dan, where's Anne?

617
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:51,165
There's no easy way
to say this, Tom,

618
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,834
so I'm just going
to say it.

619
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:56,838
Anne and Alexis
are missing -- gone.
